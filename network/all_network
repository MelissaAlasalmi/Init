// 1. Get the list of the network interfaces of the machine without displaying any detail for these interfaces. Only the list of names:
ifconfig -l

// 2a. Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics: Identify broadcast address
ifconfig | grep 'broadcast' | cut -d ' ' -f6

// 2bf. Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics: Identify all IP adresses which are part of the same subnet
arp -a | grep 'en0' | cut -d ' ' -f2

// 3. Identify the MAC address of the Wi-Fi card
ifconfig en1 | grep 'ether' | cut -d ' ' -f2

// 4. Identifiy the default gateway in the routing table
netstat -nr | grep 'default'

// 5. Identify the IP address of the DNS that responds to the following url: slash16.org
nslookup slash16.org | grep 'Server' | cut -d ':' -f2

// 6. Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server
youâ€™re using. The following command lists the same DNS as the file with the path /etc/resolv.conf:
scutil --dns | grep 'nameserver\[[0-9]*\]'

// 7. Query an external DNS server on the slash16.org domain name (ie. : google
8.8.8.8)
host slash16.org 8.8.8.8

// 8. Find the provider of slash16.org. Use the following command to find the IP address: 
host slash16.org
With the following command: 
whois 13.33.242.31
We can determine that the provider is AWS.

// 9.  Find the external IP of 42.fr. Use the following command to find the output: 
nslookup 42.fr

// 10.  Identify the network devices between your computer and the slash16.org domain
traceroute slash16.org

// 11. Use the output of the previous command to find the name and IP address of the
device that makes the link between you (local network) and the outside world. 
Use the command from the previous exercise and it's the nat.

// 12. Find the IP that was assigned to you by dhcp server
ipconfig getpacket en0 | grep yiaddr

// 13. Thanks to the previous question and the reverse DNS find the name of your host. Use the following command to get the output: 
host 10.12.4.7 | cut -d ' ' -f5

// 14. What file contains the local DNS entries?
/etc/hosts

// 15. Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85
add a line to your /etc/hosts: 46.19.122.85 infra.42.fr
